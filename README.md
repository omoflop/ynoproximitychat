# Usage
This userscript adds a minimap above the chat in yume nikki online for ease of navigating in-game
It will add two new buttons, one to toggle the visibility of the minimap, and another to edit the minimap settings
The settings menu isn't very polished yet, and any issues+pull requests are appriciated because I cannot figure it out

# Installation
1. Navigate to the [dist](https://github.com/omoflop/ynominimap/blob/dist/) branch
2. Open up [minimap.user.js](https://github.com/omoflop/ynominimap/blob/dist/minimap.user.js)
3. Press the "copy raw" button
